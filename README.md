# Intelligent Manufacturing Systems 

# Exercise 1 - Timed Petri net for simulating control of flexible manufacturing system
  
In this exercise we created a model of a manufacturing system, using petri nets. In the petri net P-Invariant and T-Invariant analysis was used, in order to check the the bound of the system as well and the deadlocks. 
## How to run

In order to run, first you must downnload software [PIPE v.4.3.0](https://sourceforge.net/projects/pipe2/).
In addition open a terminal or cmd inside Pipe directory and execute the command
```bash
java Pipe
```
